# My First Piece Of Rust

This project is the first piece of rust I've written.

## Rust Install

Rust was installed on my Windows machine using the Rustup installer [downloaded
from this
link](https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/rustup-init.exe).

After installation finished, I checked if Rust was up-to-date using the shell
command `rustup update`.

documentation, which can be found
