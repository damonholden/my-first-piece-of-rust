# My First Piece Of Rust

This project is the first piece of rust I've written.

## Rust Install

Rust was installed on my Windows machine using the Rustup installer [downloaded
from this
link](https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/rustup-init.exe).

After installation finished, I checked if Rust was up-to-date using the shell
command `rustup update`.

## VSCode Setup

Rust officially supports a single VSCode extension - Rust-analyzer, which features:

- code completion with imports insertion
- go to definition, implementation, type definition
- find all references, workspace symbol search, symbol renaming
- types and documentation on hover
- inlay hints for types and parameter names
- semantic syntax highlighting
- and more
